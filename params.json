This restriction will be removed once the project is ready for release.\r\n# What is PopcornTV?\r\n\r\nPopcornTV is a simple application that allows an Apple TV to play stream Movies and TV shows directly from torrents. It pulls from yts.to as well as the Popcorn Time TV API to allow for a smooth interface and ease of use.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nPopcornTV works by hijacking the Trailers application on the Apple TV. In order to do this effectively we change the DNS server on the Apple TV to point to your own computer/server. I created this application in 24 hours as a proof of concept that you are able to stream torrents directly to an Apple TV by generating valid XML for it to read from.\r\n\r\nWe pull all of our Movies from [YTS](https://yts.to/) by using the API that they provide. All TV shows use the [Popcorn Time TV API](https://git.popcorntime.io/popcorntime/eztv-api/tree/master)\r\n\r\n### Preview\r\n#### Preview Video\r\n[Watch the latest video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlnwrfkbna4)! Please excuse the bad video quality, it was filmed in one take on my iPhone. I will be uploading more videos in the future if so desired\r\n\r\n#### Preview Images\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uMBZnkS.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/UXQcWfp.jpg)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/rwmXmir.png)\r\n\r\n#### Workflow\r\n  - Select Trailers application on Apple TV\r\n  - Intercept the DNS request on our server, if it is requesting 'trailers.apple.com' redirect the request to our own internal webserver, if not redirect the request to Googles Public DNS server.\r\n  - Generate XML and serve it to the Apple TV\r\n  - Once a Movie is selected to be played, use Popcorn Times streamer-server to download and stream the movie to a local port.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n0.1.1a\r\n\r\n### Tech\r\n\r\nPopcornTV uses several API's and libraries.\r\n\r\n* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - Node.js® is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.\r\n* [Popcorn Streamer Server](https://git.popcorntime.io/popcorntime/streamer-server) - Download torrents and stream them on the fly to a URL\r\n* [Popcorn Time TV API](https://git.popcorntime.io/popcorntime/eztv-api/tree/master) - Grab any and all TV shows that you may desire!\r\n* [YTS API](https://yts.to/api) - An extensive database with over 5.6k movies.\r\n* [PlexConnect](https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect) - For giving me some example source code that I used before moving to Node.js\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nSection Removed until release :)\r\n\r\n### Why is it not released yet?\r\n\r\nI have decided to hold off on the initial release of this software until it is actually ready for release. Currently there are many features missing that I want to get working as well as some bugs that I wish to smash before a release from me.\r\n\r\n### Todo's\r\n\r\n```\r\n[X] Add more movie libraries\r\n[ ] Add more dynamic loading to load more then 50 results\r\n[ ] Add TV Show Support\r\n[ ] Look into Subtitle Support\r\n[ ] Add Settings\r\n[ ] Add Anime Support\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ ] Unable to stream same torrent after leaving the stream\r\n[ ] Fix Trailers support\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nWant to contribute?
