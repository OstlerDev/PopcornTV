{"name":"PopcornTV","tagline":"Stream (nearly) any Movie or TV show to your Apple TV Instantly for Free!","body":"# What is PopcornTV?\r\n\r\nPopcornTV is a simple application that allows an Apple TV to play stream Movies and TV shows directly from torrents. It pulls from yts.to as well as the Popcorn Time TV API to allow for a smooth interface and ease of use.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nPopcornTV works by hijacking the Trailers application on the Apple TV. In order to do this effectively we change the DNS server on the Apple TV to point to your own computer/server. I created this application in 24 hours as a proof of concept that you are able to stream torrents directly to an Apple TV by generating valid XML for it to read from.\r\n\r\nWe pull all of our Movies from [YTS](https://yts.to/) by using the API that they provide. All TV shows use the [Popcorn Time TV API](https://git.popcorntime.io/popcorntime/eztv-api/tree/master)\r\n\r\n### Preview\r\n#### Preview Video\r\n[Watch the latest video here!
