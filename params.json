{"name":"PopcornTV","tagline":"Project Discontinued","body":"# Project Discontinued\r\nAfter the legal action taken against certain members of the PopcornTime.io team I decided that it was best and safest to discontinue working on the project and move onto greener pastures. Thank you all for your continued support.\r\n\r\n# What was PopcornTV?\r\n\r\nPopcornTV was a simple application that allowed an Apple TV to play stream Movies and TV shows directly from torrents. It pulls from [yts.to]() as well as the [Popcorn Time TV API]() to allow users to watch most Movies and TV Shows Instantly.\r\n\r\n## How it worked\r\n\r\nPopcornTV worked by hijacking the Trailers application on the Apple TV. In order to do this effectively we changed the DNS server on the Apple TV to point to your own computer/server. This application was initially created in 24 hours as a proof of concept that you are able to stream torrents directly to an Apple TV by generating valid XML for it to read from. It has since grown into a much more full fledged application.\r\n\r\nWe pulled all of our Movies from [YTS]() by using the API that they provide. All TV shows used the [Popcorn Time TV API]()\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n### Demo Images\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7dB9zGp.jpg)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/vigyOsZ.jpg)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/296kywf.jpg)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/S0yrFHo.jpg)\r\n[More Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/bKobV)\r\n\r\n## Version History\r\n- [0.1.5 - Quality Selection, Subtitles, Favorites](https://github.com/OstlerDev/PopcornTV/releases/tag/v0.1.5)\r\n- [0.1.4 - Clean up Code, Implement Certificate Generation.
